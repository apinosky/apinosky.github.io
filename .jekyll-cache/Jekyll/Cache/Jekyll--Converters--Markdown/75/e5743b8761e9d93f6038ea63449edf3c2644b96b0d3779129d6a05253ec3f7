I"<p>In the second quarter of my graduate program, I took a Robot Operating System (ROS), which built on the prior embedded systems course <a href="/graduate_projects/2019/12/21/ROS/">link</a>. All assignments in this course were programmed in C++ (different than the prior course which used Python). This page highlights the quarter-long project completed throughout this course.</p>
