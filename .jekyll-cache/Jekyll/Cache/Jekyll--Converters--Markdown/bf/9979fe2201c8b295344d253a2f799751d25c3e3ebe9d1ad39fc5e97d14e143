I led a three-student project development team as part of Biomedical Instrumentation in the spring of my junior year (Spring 2014). For this project, we interviewed an anesthesiologist to discover existing needs in the emergency room. From this conversation, we decided to pursue the development of a hand-held pressure sensor. We designed and constructed a compact, battery-powered pressure detection device with LED and buzzer indicators. This device included a removable, hand-held pressure bulb attachment. I also developed a LabVIEW program to allow an operator to interface with the device. This program included calibration and reset settings. The program initiated a beep, analyzed the amount of pressure that the patient applied to bulb, measured the response time, and informed the operator of patientâ€™s awareness level under conscious sedation.</p>
