I"R<p>On February 27, I competed in a fast-paced business pitch competition on in Danville, Virginia at an event called <a href="http://ideafestdanville.com/">IdeaFest 2015</a>. A preliminary proposal to pitch was submitted prior to the competition, and out of those applications, 20 teams were offered slots to pitch. Each team was allotted 2 minutes to pitch their idea, followed by 3 minutes of Q&amp;A by a panel of 5 judges. <!--more--> Pitches were expected to cover: (i) the product or service, (ii) the value proposition, (iii) the target market, (iv) the market size, (v) differentiation, (vi) the revenue model, and (vii) a revenue estimate. The use of PowerPoint/slide presentations was not permitted. I pitched along with two other members of my senior design team, DeltaDose. We pitched our <a href="/2015/03/27/senior-design/">Senior Design</a> Project. Our team won First Place and the Audience Choice Award. For First Place, our team received $5,000 and 25 hours of business consulting to put towards our senior design project. We additionally received $500 for the Audience Choice Award.</p>
