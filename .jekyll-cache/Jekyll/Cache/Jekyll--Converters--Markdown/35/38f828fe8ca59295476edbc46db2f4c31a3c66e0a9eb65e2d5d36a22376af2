I"é<p>I participated in the <a href="https://assistcenter.org/">ASSIST Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU)</a> at North Carolina State University (NC State) in the summer preceding my senior year (2015). Through this program, I had the opportunity of working in Dr. Alper Bozkurtâ€™s <a href="http://ibionics.ece.ncsu.edu/main.html">iBionics Lab</a> at NC State. Throughout the summer, I worked on projects developing a wearable, low-powered environment and health monitoring system for use in non clinical settings. I presented a poster (below) at the conclusion of a summer research position at the NC State Summer Undergraduate Research Symposium.</p>
