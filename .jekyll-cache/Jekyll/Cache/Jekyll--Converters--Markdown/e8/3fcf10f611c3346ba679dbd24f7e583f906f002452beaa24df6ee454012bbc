I"Ô<p>In the first quarter of my graduate program, I took a project-based course, which provided experience with a variety of software tools and concepts useful for a robotics engineer working with practical embedded systems. In this course, I learned how to use the Robot Operating System (ROS), with all major assignments programmed in Python. This page highlights the final project completed at the end of the course. The ‚Äútheme‚Äù of the final project was <em>Recreational Robotics</em>.</p>
