I"v<p>The final project for Intro to Materials Science was a reverse engineering project. For the project, we were asked to reverse-engineer the 1994 Navajo bridge which spans the Grand Canyon in a remote area of northern Arizona. The instructions were to reverse-engineer the bridge using only the pictures and bridge statistics provided and some research into material properties of steel and concrete as appropriate.<!--more--> A Matlab-based truss solver was used to model the internal forces and deflection of the bridge under its load. Additionally we were instructed to investigate an open-ended question of our choosing.</p>
