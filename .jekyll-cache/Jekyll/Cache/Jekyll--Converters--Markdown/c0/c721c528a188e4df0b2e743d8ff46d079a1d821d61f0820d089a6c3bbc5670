I"ì<p>For our junior design course, we designed, manufactured, and constructed syringe pump. The device controlled volume and rate of fluid administered by syringe using rotations of stepper motor. Several SolidWorks models were developed throughout the design process. Modification were implemented following feedback from design review presentations. The pump includes an acrylic base, along with a stepper motor fixed in place by a backplate. The syringe holder and base rollers were designed in SolidWorks and printed in ABS plastic on a Fusion Deposition Modeling (FDM) machine. All gears were ordered from McMaster-Carr. Operated device using PIC micro-controller programmed in C.Completed project under $100 budget with three-student team.</p>
