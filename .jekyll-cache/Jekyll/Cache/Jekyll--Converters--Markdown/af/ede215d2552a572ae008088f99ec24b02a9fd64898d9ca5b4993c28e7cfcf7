I"I<p>This project was the first opportunity in the BME design sequence to design and print a SolidWorks model of our choosing. Previous to this project, I acquired solid modeling proficiency through SolidWorks tutorial sequence. I developed spinning top with engraved surface in SolidWorks (right). Before printing the part, I tested it under variety of stresses. Finally, I converted the solid part to a printable format and printed it on the labâ€™s 3D printer.</p>
