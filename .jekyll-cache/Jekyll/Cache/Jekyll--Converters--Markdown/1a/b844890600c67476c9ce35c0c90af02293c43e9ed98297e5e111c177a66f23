I"ñ	<p>Two YOCLKs (your own clock) were constructed to produce waveforms of different frequencies. Both circuits included astable multivibrators and are intended to operate with Vs+ = 5V. An LED was used to visually demonstrate the function of the CLK.</p>

<p>The first YOCLK was constructed to operate at a frequency of 5Hz. R1 was a 100kÎ© resistor, R2 was a 1.5MÎ© resistor, and C1 was a 0.1ÂµF electrolytic capacitor. Additionally, a 0.1ÂµF capacitor was connected to pin 5 which was subsequently connected to ground to reduce noise, and pin 4 was connected to Vs +. Once the components were soldered onto the circuit board, the circuit had a frequency of 4.386Hz and a duty cycle of 51.32%.</p>

<p>The second YOCLK was constructed to operate at a frequency of ~1.18Hz. R1 was a1kÎ© resistor, R2 was a 150kÎ© resistor, and C1 was a4.7ÂµF electrolytic capacitor. Additionally, a 0.1ÂµF capacitor was connected to pin 5 which was subsequently connected to ground to reduce noise, and pin 4 was connected to Vs +. Once the components were soldered onto the circuit board, the circuit had a frequency of 1.179Hz and a duty cycle of 52.60%.</p>
