<p><img src="/assets/images/alliep3.png" alt="Allie" style="float: right" /></p>

<p>My name is Allison (Allie) Pinosky. I am currently located in Chicago, pursuing a PhD in Mechanical Engineering at Northwestern University. I am focusing on robotics with the <a href="https://murpheylab.github.io/">Murphey Lab</a> within the <a href="https://robotics.northwestern.edu/">Center for Robotics and Biosystems</a>.</p>

<p>Previously, I worked as an engineer at MIT Lincoln Laboratory. While working at the Lab, I had the opportunity to work on the payload for TESSâ€“<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/tess-transiting-exoplanet-survey-satellite">NASAâ€™s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite</a>.  I graduated from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2015 with a degree in Biomedical Engineeringâ€“Go Heels!</p>

<p>Beyond engineering, Iâ€™ve had some business exposure through the Kenan-Flagler UNC Business Essentials Certificate Program and working as a business analyst intern for a summer. I created this website as an online portfolio and resume to highlight the projects I have worked on.</p>

<p>I am always seeking hands-on opportunities to expand my engineering base. I have special interests in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Active Learning</li>
  <li>Hybrid Control</li>
  <li>Complex Prototypes</li>
  <li>Mechanical Engineering and Mechanism Design</li>
  <li>Systems Thinking</li>
  <li>Medical Devices</li>
  <li>Biomechanics</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="extracurricular-interests"><strong>Extracurricular Interests</strong></h1>

<p>In my free time, I enjoy reading, cooking, hiking, spending time with friends, traveling, and volunteering.</p>

<p>I am currently a member of the Professional Development Committee for the Graduate Student Chapter of the Society of Women Engineers at Northwestern (GradSWE). In May 2021, I helped plan a one-day in-person professional development conference for engineering graduate students (organized by GradSWE). I am also a member of the board for the Mechanical Engineering Graduate Student Society (MEGSS).</p>

<p>In Boston, I volunteered with the <a href="https://www.jbbbs.org/friend-2-friend-programs/">Friend 2 Friend</a> program at Jewish Big Brothers Big Sisters of Greater Boston. Friend 2 Friend provides adults who have disabilities the opportunity to make a new friend, socialize, stay active and be connected to the community. Volunteers spend a few hours each month helping another adult feel special.</p>

<p>Throughout my undergraduate career, I was particularly active in an organization called <a href="http://www.carolinaftk.org/">Carolina For the Kids</a> (formerly UNC Dance Marathon). This organization benefits the patients and families served by UNC Childrenâ€™s Hospital.</p>
