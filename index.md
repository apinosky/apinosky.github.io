# **About Me**

![Allie](/assets/images/alliep3.png){: style="float: right"}

My name is Allison (Allie) Pinosky. I am currently located in Chicago, pursuing a PhD in Mechanical Engineering at Northwestern University. I am focusing on robotics with the [Murphey Lab](https://murpheylab.github.io/) within the [Center for Robotics and Biosystems](https://robotics.northwestern.edu/).

Previously, I worked as an engineer at MIT Lincoln Laboratory. While working at the Lab, I had the opportunity to work on the payload for TESS--[NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite](https://www.nasa.gov/tess-transiting-exoplanet-survey-satellite).  I graduated from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2015 with a degree in Biomedical Engineering--Go Heels!

Beyond engineering, I've had some business exposure through the Kenan-Flagler UNC Business Essentials Certificate Program and working as a business analyst intern for a summer. I created this website as an online portfolio and resume to highlight the projects I have worked on.

I am always seeking hands-on opportunities to expand my engineering base. I have special interests in:

- Active Learning
- Hybrid Control
- Complex Prototypes
- Mechanical Engineering and Mechanism Design
- Systems Thinking
- Medical Devices
- Biomechanics

# **Extracurricular Interests**

In my free time, I enjoy reading, cooking, hiking, spending time with friends, traveling, and volunteering.

I am currently a member of the Professional Development Committee for the Graduate Student Chapter of the Society of Women Engineers at Northwestern (GradSWE). In May 2021, I helped plan a one-day in-person professional development conference for engineering graduate students (organized by GradSWE). I am also a member of the board for the Mechanical Engineering Graduate Student Society (MEGSS).

In Boston, I volunteered with the [Friend 2 Friend](https://www.jbbbs.org/friend-2-friend-programs/) program at Jewish Big Brothers Big Sisters of Greater Boston. Friend 2 Friend provides adults who have disabilities the opportunity to make a new friend, socialize, stay active and be connected to the community. Volunteers spend a few hours each month helping another adult feel special.

Throughout my undergraduate career, I was particularly active in an organization called [Carolina For the Kids](http://www.carolinaftk.org/) (formerly UNC Dance Marathon). This organization benefits the patients and families served by UNC Children's Hospital.
