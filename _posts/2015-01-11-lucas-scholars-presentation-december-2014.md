The designation as a Lucas Scholar is an honor given to the top BME undergraduate students at the UNC and NC State to encourage research through the summer and the academic year. At the end of the fall semester senior year, the students give a talk regarding their research as part of the weekly departmental seminars <!--more-->([Lucas Scholars Seminar Announcement pdf](/assets/pdfs/bme_seminar_dec-3_lucas_scholars.pdf)). At this seminar, I had the opportunity to preset the research I conducted in [Dr. Bozkurt's iBionicS Lab](http://ibionics.ece.ncsu.edu/main.html) during the summer and fall semester.
