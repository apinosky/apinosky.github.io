Each year, the UNC/NC State Joint BME Department holds a research retreat to break down the traditional separation between the departments and promote interactions and drive innovation. The 2014 research retreat was held at the NC Biotech Center in RTP. The one-day retreat featured key note speakers, a plenary session, oral presentations by selected graduate students, and poster presentations by both graduate and undergraduate students <!--more-->([2014 Research Retreat Announcement](/assets/pdfs/2014-research-retreat-announcement.pdf)). I had the opportunity to present my poster from the summer at this retreat.
