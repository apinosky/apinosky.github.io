<p> This section highlights many of the projects I worked on while in the
    Biomedical Engineering Department at the University of North Carolina
    at Chapel Hill. Team projects have the names of each team member at the
    bottom of the project page. For team projects I have attempted to
    highlight the specific parts of the project that I worked on,
    where possible; however, some projects had the entire team
    collaborating on each aspect of the project.
