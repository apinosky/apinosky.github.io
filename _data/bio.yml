mission: Bringing robots into the real world by designing efficient algorithms for planning, control and estimation.
tldr: I recently graduated with a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from <a href="https://northwestern.edu/"  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Northwestern University</a>. My research with the <a href="https://murpheylab.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Murphey Lab</a>  within the <a href="https://robotics.northwestern.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Center for Robotics and Biosystems</a> focused on active learning with robots. I'm currently staying on as a postdoc as I look for my next opportunity.
bio:  I have a PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Northwestern University where I studied how machine learning can be used to improve robot perception and control. At Northwestern, I worked with <a href="https://robotics.northwestern.edu/people/profiles/faculty/murphey-todd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Professor Todd Murphey</a>. Prior to starting my doctoral studies I was an Associate Technical Staff member at <a href="https://www.ll.mit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MIT Lincoln Laboratory</a> where I worked in the systems engineering and rapid prototyping groups. I received a B.S. in Applied Scienceâ€“Biomedical Engineering from the <a href="https://www.unc.edu/"  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a>, where I worked with <a href="https://bme.unc.edu/bme-person/caterina-gallippi/"   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Professor Catarina Gallippi</a> on using signal separation techniques to delineate the mechanical properites of tissue from ultrasound waves. 
extracurricular: |
  In my free time, I enjoy reading, cooking, hiking, spending time with friends, and volunteering. 
  <br><br>
  I've particularly enjoyed volunteering with <a href="https://prescientist.org/volunteers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Letters to a Pre-Scientist</a>, <a href="https://www.jbbbs.org/friend-2-friend-programs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Friend 2 Friend</a>, and <a href="http://www.carolinaftk.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Carolina For the Kids</a> (formerly UNC Dance Marathon).
  <br><br>
  At Northwestern, I also enjoyed sharing my research with the broader community as a yearly exhibitor at the <a href="https://www.msichicago.org/explore/whats-here/events/robot-block-party" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Robot Block Party</a>. I was also a member of <a href="https://sites.northwestern.edu/gradswe/index/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GradSWE</a> and the Mechanical Engineering Graduate Student Society (MEGSS).
